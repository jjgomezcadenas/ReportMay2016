The NEW tracking plane is (TP) permits the reconstruction of the trajectories of charged particles, in particular electrons, in the NEW/NEXT detectors. It consists of a matrix of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) which operate as light pixels, providing a 2D picture of the event (the third coordinate is given by the drift time). The SiPMs are 1-mm in size are radiopure 1-mm sensors, manufactured by SENSL. The TP is made of 28 radiopure circuits called Kapton DICE-Boards (KDB). Each KDB has an $8\times8$~ SiPM array, where each SiPM is placed at a 1-cm pitch. Each KDB also includes a NTC temperature sensor and one LED for calibration. The KDBs over-cover the fiducial region with $\sim$1800 SiPMs, ensuring that there are no dead regions. The connector is located at the end of a long tail, and is screened from the gas, in the fiducial volume, by a 120 mm thick copper shield.

%The DICE-Boards (DBs) for NEXT-DEMO were made of multi-layer CuFlon, and their radioactivity budget was moderately high, due to the adhesive needed to glue the layers. Two additional problems with the DBs were the need to solder SiPMs by hand (since CuFlon does not tolerate the temperatures of an oven) and the need to use connectors (all of which are known to be non radiopure).
%The NEW/NEXT KDBs are made of Kapton, and their measured radioactivity budget (only upper limits are available) is very low. The connector is located at the end of a long tail, and is screened from the gas by a thick copper layer. In addition, TPB was coated directly on top of the DEMO DBs. Instead, the design of the electroluminescent region with a quartz plate allows for a direct coating of the plate instead of the individual DICE-Boards.
