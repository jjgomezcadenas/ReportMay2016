\section{Reflectors}

The material of choice for the KDBs (Kapton) as many advantages including flexibility, little degassing and radiopurity. However it is a poor reflector. In order to increase the amount of light recorded by the energy plane, a 2 mm teflon reflector is placed in front of each KDB. The reflectors (Fig. \ref{fig:reflector}) have holes to accommodate the SiPMs without damaging them and also have a space for the thermal sensor and the LEDs. However no holes are neccesary for the LEDs, since teflon is sufficiently transparent to the blue light they emit.
