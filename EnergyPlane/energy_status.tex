The energy plane has been installed in the NEW detector. The PMTs are glued to the sapphire windows and they are properly coated with PEDOT and TPB. The new bases are being installed during the last two weeks of April. The results of the first FEE prototype are currently being tested at IFIC with a whole chain (PMT to DAQ) and the results will be ready by the second week of April. The new FEEs will be mounted and ready to use in the LSC by the end of April.
