\section{Energy plane design}
\label{sec:design}
The energy plane (shown in figure~\ref{fig:des})
consists of a 11 ~cm thick copper support plate with 12 copper window
covered with brazed sapphire windows fixed to the front of the plate. The
set-up as a whole seals the pressure vessel from the PMT-region,
which is held at vacuum levels of
$<10^{-4}$~mbar. Additional copper shielding fixed to the
vacuum side of the apertures, offer further shielding against gammas traversing the PMTs and
entering in the detector volume. The 12 Hamamatsu R11410 PMTs are optically coupled to 
the sapphire window using NyoGel OCK-451. The sensors are held in place by a plastic brace and spring.

The PMTs receive high voltage and have their signal extracted via a
shielded twisted pair cable connected to a feedthrough in the energy-plane head. The distribution of
signal and supply at each individual PMT is controlled via a
Kapton circuit board (base), covered with a
copper cap filled with epoxy and connected to the support plate. The cap acts as a heat sink.

Figure \ref{fig:des} shows a transversal cut of the design of the energy plane and a frontal view of the copper mother-can. The PMTs position is clearly visible in the frontal view.
